# KNIME_Projects

I have made the first round of projects available. I am working through a time series analysis using KNIME that should be posted sometime in the near future. This was a fun exercise. 

KNIME was wasy to learn. I can easily see how KNIME quickens the process of creating Data Science models.

I have other small minor projects (that do not rise to the significance to where I will post them) that I have learned some other tricks of KNIME.
